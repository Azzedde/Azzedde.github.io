- name: "Agents Hack Unaite x Hugging Face"

  project_name: "Helping investors and VCs making informed decisions"
  details: |
    <img src="/assets/images/huggingface_hackathon_picture.png" alt="Interactive investigation tree in Sherlock" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 1em;">
    <p>
      At Hugging Face’s Paris headquarters 
      I took part in the Agents Hack organized by Unaite and Anthropic, together with 
      Ahmed Sidi Ahmed, Ferhat Addour, and Abdoulaye Doucouré.
    </p>

    <p>
      We built a multi-agent system designed to support VCs in their decision-making: 
      quickly understanding a market, brainstorming ideas, evaluating technical feasibility, 
      analyzing financial insights, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the frontend, we let users drag and drop the agents they want to activate, 
      and the orchestrator dynamically planned the interactions between the selected agents.
    </p>

    <p>
      We didn’t win.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was short — from 10:00 to 18:30 — but it was a really good experience!
    </p>
