    <p>This one is special. I built it out of a real needâ€”my obsession with learning while on the move. Whether I'm running or on public transport, I wanted to turn research papers into podcast-style conversations.</p>
    <p>This tool simulates a lively discussion between three AI personas (Host, Learner, Expert) to make complex topics accessible. Every detailâ€”from planning to TTSâ€”was designed with clarity and engagement in mind.</p>

    <p>Sometimes ChatGPT isn't structured enough for real ideation. That's why I built Brainstormersâ€”an app that mimics real-world brainstorming techniques with LangChain and Streamlit.</p>
    <p>It supports SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, Starbursting, and more. It's my go-to tool when I want to explore new directions and break through mental blocks.</p>

    <p>I've always been fascinated by storytelling and visuals. This project automates the generation of eerie horror/suspense stories with matching visuals and soundâ€”perfect for TikTok-style content.</p>
    <p>GPT-4o-mini handles the plot; Flux generates images, and my custom movie.py stitches it all into one final video.</p>

  details: |
    <p>An experimental game where you survive using HP, mana, and luckâ€”all generated by LLMs and visualized via Flux-generated images.</p>
    <p>I used LangChain to structure event logic and designed all the game logic myself. While simple, it opened new doors for LLM-based interactivity.</p>
