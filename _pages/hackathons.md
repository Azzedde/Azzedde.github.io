  <div class="project-details">
    <p>
      A four-day hackathon uniting Université Paris-Saclay, Paris 8, and UQAC, sponsored by six leading companies.  
      My team (Ahmed SIDI AHMED, Nazim Keskes, Ilyes Djerfaf, and I) tackled the real-world need for automated COBOL documentation.  
      We conducted a targeted literature review, fine-tuned a 3 B-parameter LLM for “COBOL → documentation,” and shipped a VS Code extension that auto-generates code comments and sequence diagrams.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Runner-up (2nd place) out of 27 teams, with detailed feedback from a 6-member jury.</li>
      <li><strong>Skills gained:</strong> Rapid domain research, model fine-tuning, VS Code API integration.</li>

  <div class="project-details">
    <p>
      At ESSEC Cergy, we joined 36 participants to build “Sherlock,” a security-breach investigation agent.  
      Using a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and AWS Bedrock (Claude models), Sherlock visualizes hypotheses in an interactive tree and generates detailed investigation reports.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Features:</strong> AI-powered hypothesis generation, node expansion, plausibility marking.</li>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Demonstrated the power of agentic frameworks for cybersecurity.</li>
