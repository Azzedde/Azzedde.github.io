## 🧠 Paper-to-Podcast

![Paper-to-Podcast screenshot](/assets/images/paper_to_podcast.png)

This one is special. I built it out of a real need—my obsession with learning while on the move. Whether I’m running or on public transport, I wanted to turn research papers into podcast-style conversations. This tool simulates a lively discussion between three AI personas (Host, Learner, Expert) to make complex topics accessible. Every detail—from planning to TTS—was designed with clarity and engagement in mind.

## 🔍 Brainstormers

Sometimes ChatGPT isn’t structured enough for real ideation. That’s why I built Brainstormers—an app that mimics real-world brainstorming techniques with LangChain and Streamlit. It supports SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, Starbursting, and more. It’s my go-to tool when I want to explore new directions and break through mental blocks.

## 🎥 Story Videos Generator

I’ve always been fascinated by storytelling and visuals. This project automates the generation of eerie horror/suspense stories with matching visuals and sound—perfect for TikTok-style content. GPT-4o-mini handles the plot; Flux generates images, and my custom movie.py stitches it all into one final video.

## 🎮 LLM Story Game

An experimental game where you survive using HP, mana, and luck—all generated by LLMs and visualized via Flux-generated images. I used LangChain to structure event logic and designed all the game logic myself. While simple, it opened new doors for LLM-based interactivity.

## 📊 Dagster QA Extractor

This one is for anyone prepping interviews or building QA datasets. The pipeline takes technical content and turns it into clean, structured Q\&A pairs using locally deployed LLMs and Dagster. I learned a lot about scalable pipelines and local inference.
