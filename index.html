<p>"Who am I?" It's a tough question, but I aim to live so fully that, at my last breath, I can smile and say, "What a life!" I dream of chasing polar lights, publishing at NeurIPS and ICML, and building intelligent homes with my own code. I'll build wealth not for luxury but to uplift those in need, delight my future family, and power my own GPU server farm. Yet I'm more than my ambitions or my achievements, I'm driven by curiosity, by code, and by the conviction that even the smallest voice can leave an enduring mark.</p>
